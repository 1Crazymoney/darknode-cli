## 2.0. Installing and deploying a Darknode.
This section explains how to install and setup your Darknode once you’ve been accepted. To apply to be a Darknode Operator, [visit section 1: Apply](./01-apply.md).



## 2.1. Receiving Kovan Testnet Tokens
When your application is approved, the Republic Protocol Bot will ask for your wallet’s Kovan public key to deposit tokens into.

This is so you can deposit the 100,000REN required to operate a Darknode. Darknode’s also take a small amount of ETH to operate (about 0.1ETH per week). 

Input your Kovan Test Network public key into the chat with the Republic Protocol Bot. 

The tokens will appear in your wallet shortly. Please allow up to 1 hour. 

Note: Make sure you retain at least 1 ETH and 100,000REN to operate the Darknode.


## 2.2. Setting up Amazon Web Servers (AWS)

At the moment, we only provide support for Amazon Web Servers. Checkout our [Getting started on AWS](./getting-started-on-aws.md) guide. Make sure you visit the URL presented to you before going to the next steps.


## 2.3. Registering a Darknode
To register your Darknode on the Republic Protocol network, click the Register button on the Darknode Operation Dashboard.

You’ll be asked to approve the transfer of 100,000REN by your wallet. 

Confirm the transaction and wait. Your Darknode will be registered, however you will need to wait up to 24 hours. 

## 2.4. Depositing ETH to operate Darknode

For a Darknode to be fully operational (and earning fees) it will also need ETH, required so that it can pay gas fees. Under the ‘Top-up Balance’ section enter the amount of ETH you would like to deposit. During Testnet, we recommend 1 ETH.

Note: Republic Protocol is interested in improving the systems in place for monitoring the current ETH balance of your Darknode. Let us know how you think it could be improved.
